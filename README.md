# EllipticCurve
Implementation Elliptic Curve Cryptography


Instructions on how and where to run the program.
1. python main.py


What to expect from the program?
1. Program uses plain text from user input to encrypt the message by mapping it into Elliptic Curve 
Point and then decrypt to original message.
2. Program contains two .py files main.py and eliptic_curve.py
- Main.py is where main flow of program goes and there is implemented key exchange 
algorithm by encrypting and decrypting messages
- Eliptic_cuve.py is where the class of elliptic curve is implemented to help project our points.
3. Please read or watch other “presentation.pdf” file to get explanation on the logic of the 
program and explanation of the decryption algorithm, encryption algorithm and adding points 
on Elliptic Curves. 
4. The program is implemented by using a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to make it more visual and 
interactive, so once you run the program, the GUI window should appear. 
5. Once you run the program, type any message in the raw “Message” and click “Send” button so it 
will start encoding/decoding the message, and do NOT try to input the values into the other 
fields, since they are only for outputs. You might also clear all your inputs from all the fields by 
using “Clear” button in the bottom
